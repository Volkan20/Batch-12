Inheritance in Java:
   This is mechanism in java through which one class can acquire the properties
   and methods from another class.
   The class from which we acquire the properties is called parent/superclass/baseclass
   and the class which acquire the properties and methods is called
   child class/ derived class/ subclass
Advantages:
    1) Code duplication is reduced.
    2) Saves Memory
    3) Execution time is less
Disadvantages:
    Classes get tightly coupled. If we change some in the parent it will affect all the
    children classes and we have to make sure that this new change is compatible with the
    that we have in the children classes.
When we should use Inheritance:
if there is a case in which we would have to use the same methods in many classes
 and classes are closely related to each different classes
the best practice would be to create a parent class and use it to extend the methods
into the subclasses

Types of Inheritance:
we have 4 types inheritance --> single / hierarchical / multilevel / multiple

1) Single Inheritance:
in single inheritance we have only one parent and only one child class
class Animal{
}
class Dog extends Animal{
}

2) Hierarchical Inheritance:
we have only one parent class and multiple children classes
class Animal{
}
class Dog extends Animal{
}
class Cat extends Animal{
}

3) Multilevel Inheritance:
If we have one parent and one child class and many intermediate classes it's called multilevel
class Human{
}
class Employee extends Human{
}
class Teacher extends Employee{
}

4) Multiple Inheritance:
in Multiple Inheritance we have a single child class and multiple parent classes: This
is not supported in Java with classes but possible with the help of interfaces.
class Display{
int resolution;
}
class Keyboard{
int noOfKeys
}
class Laptop extends Display,Keyboard{
}

Rules:
    1) Private members are not inherited (private fields and private methods)
    2) Constructors don't participate in inheritance
    3) if we have constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor
    in the children classes as well
    4) in Java a subclass can only extends single parent class
