Wrapper classes:
They are object types for all the primitive types. When we use the wrapper classes
we get the benefits of classes and objects for example we can have built-in methods.
Also, generics works with only classes.

Boxing in wrapper classes:
Boxing happens when we convert a primitive to corresponding wrapper type.
int num=10;
Integer num2=new Integer(num) // boxing
unboxing happends when we convert a wrapper object to a corresponding primitive type
