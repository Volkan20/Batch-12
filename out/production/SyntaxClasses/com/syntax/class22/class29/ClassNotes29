Set in Java:
    Set in an interface in collections framework which is implemented bt many classes for example.
    HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeHashSet.
Properties of Set:
    All the Sets don't allow duplicates
HashSet:
    1) HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
    2) It is the fastest in all Sets
    3) Most widely used Set
LinkedHasSet:
    1) Maintains the insertion order
    2) Slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions
TreeSet:
    1) Sorts the data in natural order. for number in increasing order
    2) It is slowest when it comes to store the data.
When to use which type of Set:
    1) If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted always use HashSet
    2) If we need the insertion order we(Batch 12) don't have much choice
    we have to use the LinkedHashSet But if we don't care about the insertion order
    we can compare it with TreeSet
  === LinkedSet        vs       TreeHashSet ===
   Insertion is now slow      Slowest in insertion
   Retrieval is super slow    Slower than HashSet but Faster than LinkedHashSet

I don't care about insertion order but I care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
 --- HashSet ---
I care about insertion order but, I don't care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
 --- LinkedHashSet ---
I want to have sorted data all the time?
---TreeSet ---
